# Westpac Outstanding Women Awards Portal

The official open-source web application for the Papua New Guinea Westpac Outstanding Women (WOW) Awards, an annual event that recognizes incredible women across different sectors for their achievements and contributions to business, private sector, community, entrepreneurship, and youth development/representation.

\*Disclaimer: This is not a project commissioned by Westpac but a community project started to help provide a central platform for Papua New Guineans to access the stories and work of amazing women in PNG doing incredible things.
